Continuous model upgrades
With the release of gpt-3.5-turbo, some of our models are now being continually updated. We also offer static model versions that developers can continue using for at least three months after an updated model has been introduced. With the new cadence of model updates, we are also giving people the ability to contribute evals to help us improve the model for different use cases. If you are interested, check out the OpenAI Evals repository.

The following models are the temporary snapshots, we will announce their deprecation dates once updated versions are available. If you want to use the latest model version, use the standard model names like gpt-4 or gpt-3.5-turbo.

MODEL NAME	DEPRECATION DATE
gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	TBD
gpt-4-0314	TBD
gpt-4-32k-0314	TBD
GPT-4 Limited beta
GPT-4 is a large multimodal model (accepting text inputs and emitting text outputs today, with image inputs coming in the future) that can solve difficult problems with greater accuracy than any of our previous models, thanks to its broader general knowledge and advanced reasoning capabilities. Like gpt-3.5-turbo, GPT-4 is optimized for chat but works well for traditional completions tasks both using the Chat Completions API. Learn how to use GPT-4 in our chat guide.

GPT-4 is currently in a limited beta and only accessible to those who have been granted access. Please join the waitlist to get access when capacity is available.
LATEST MODEL	DESCRIPTION	MAX TOKENS	TRAINING DATA
gpt-4	More capable than any GPT-3.5 model, able to do more complex tasks, and optimized for chat. Will be updated with our latest model iteration.	8,192 tokens	Up to Sep 2021
gpt-4-0314	Snapshot of gpt-4 from March 14th 2023. Unlike gpt-4, this model will not receive updates, and will be deprecated 3 months after a new version is released.	8,192 tokens	Up to Sep 2021
gpt-4-32k	Same capabilities as the base gpt-4 mode but with 4x the context length. Will be updated with our latest model iteration.	32,768 tokens	Up to Sep 2021
gpt-4-32k-0314	Snapshot of gpt-4-32 from March 14th 2023. Unlike gpt-4-32k, this model will not receive updates, and will be deprecated 3 months after a new version is released.	32,768 tokens	Up to Sep 2021
For many basic tasks, the difference between GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 models is not significant. However, in more complex reasoning situations, GPT-4 is much more capable than any of our previous models.

GPT-3.5
GPT-3.5 models can understand and generate natural language or code. Our most capable and cost effective model in the GPT-3.5 family is gpt-3.5-turbo which has been optimized for chat but works well for traditional completions tasks as well.

LATEST MODEL	DESCRIPTION	MAX TOKENS	TRAINING DATA
gpt-3.5-turbo	Most capable GPT-3.5 model and optimized for chat at 1/10th the cost of text-davinci-003. Will be updated with our latest model iteration.	4,096 tokens	Up to Sep 2021
gpt-3.5-turbo-0301	Snapshot of gpt-3.5-turbo from March 1st 2023. Unlike gpt-3.5-turbo, this model will not receive updates, and will be deprecated 3 months after a new version is released.	4,096 tokens	Up to Sep 2021
text-davinci-003	Can do any language task with better quality, longer output, and consistent instruction-following than the curie, babbage, or ada models. Also supports inserting completions within text.	4,097 tokens	Up to Jun 2021
text-davinci-002	Similar capabilities to text-davinci-003 but trained with supervised fine-tuning instead of reinforcement learning	4,097 tokens	Up to Jun 2021
code-davinci-002	Optimized for code-completion tasks	8,001 tokens	Up to Jun 2021
We recommend using gpt-3.5-turbo over the other GPT-3.5 models because of its lower cost.

OpenAI models are non-deterministic, meaning that identical inputs can yield different outputs. Setting temperature to 0 will make the outputs mostly deterministic, but a small amount of variability may remain.
Feature-specific models
While the new gpt-3.5-turbo model is optimized for chat, it works very well for traditional completion tasks. The original GPT-3.5 models are optimized for text completion.

Our endpoints for creating embeddings and editing text use their own sets of specialized models.

Finding the right model
Experimenting with gpt-3.5-turbo is a great way to find out what the API is capable of doing. After you have an idea of what you want to accomplish, you can stay with gpt-3.5-turbo or another model and try to optimize around its capabilities.

You can use the GPT comparison tool that lets you run different models side-by-side to compare outputs, settings, and response times and then download the data into an Excel spreadsheet.

DALL·E Beta
DALL·E is a AI system that can create realistic images and art from a description in natural language. We currently support the ability, given a prommpt, to create a new image with a certain size, edit an existing image, or create variations of a user provided image.

The current DALL·E model available through our API is the 2nd iteration of DALL·E with more realistic, accurate, and 4x greater resolution images than the original model. You can try it through the our Labs interface or via the API.

Whisper Beta
Whisper is a general-purpose speech recognition model. It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is also a multi-task model that can perform multilingual speech recognition as well as speech translation and language identification. The Whisper v2-large model is currently available through our API with the whisper-1 model name.

Currently, there is no difference between the open source version of Whisper and the version available through our API. However, through our API, we offer an optimized inference process which makes running Whisper through our API much faster than doing it through other means. For more technical details on Whisper, you can read the paper.

Embeddings
Embeddings are a numerical representation of text that can be used to measure the relateness between two pieces of text. Our second generation embedding model, text-embedding-ada-002 is a designed to replace the previous 16 first-generation embedding models at a fraction of the cost. Embeddings are useful for search, clustering, recommendations, anomaly detection, and classification tasks. You can read more about our latest embedding model in the announcement blog post.

Moderation
The Moderation models are designed to check whether content complies with OpenAI's usage policies. The models provide classification capabilities that look for content in the following categories: hate, hate/threatening, self-harm, sexual, sexual/minors, violence, and violence/graphic. You can find out more in our moderation guide.

Moderation models take in an arbitrary sized input that is automatically broken up to fix the models specific context window.

MODEL	DESCRIPTION
text-moderation-latest	Most capable moderation model. Accuracy will be slighlty higher than the stable model
text-moderation-stable	Almost as capable as the latest model, but slightly older.
GPT-3
GPT-3 models can understand and generate natural language. These models were superceded by the more powerful GPT-3.5 generation models. However, the original GPT-3 base models (davinci, curie, ada, and babbage) are current the only models that are available to fine-tune.
