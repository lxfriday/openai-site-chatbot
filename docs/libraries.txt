Libraries
Python library
We provide a Python library, which you can install as follows:

$ pip install openai
Once installed, you can use the bindings and your secret key to run the following:

import os
import openai

# Load your API key from an environment variable or secret management service
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

response = openai.Completion.create(model="text-davinci-003", prompt="Say this is a test", temperature=0, max_tokens=7)
The bindings also will install a command-line utility you can use as follows:

$ openai api completions.create -m text-davinci-003 -p "Say this is a test" -t 0 -M 7 --stream
Node.js library
We also have a Node.js library, which you can install by running the following command in your Node.js project directory:

$ npm install openai
Once installed, you can use the library and your secret key to run the following:

const { Configuration, OpenAIApi } = require("openai");
const configuration = new Configuration({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);
const response = await openai.createCompletion({
  model: "text-davinci-003",
  prompt: "Say this is a test",
  temperature: 0,
  max_tokens: 7,
});
